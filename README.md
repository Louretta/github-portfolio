## About Me

I'm a passionate DevOps innovator who bridges business and tech worlds. I transform IT challenges into streamlined, scalable solutions using AWS and Azure. From support roles to cloud orchestration, my journey fuels a passion for continuous improvement. Turning complexity into efficiency â€“ that's my code

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### [Java-Monolitic-Application](https://github.com/Louretta/java-monolitic-app.git)
Here's a brief description incorporating the key features:

This project implements a highly available Java enterprise application on AWS, featuring multi-AZ deployment with Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing. It utilizes a robust CI/CD pipeline (Jenkins, GitHub, SonarQube, Maven) and Ansible for automated deployment. Nexus Repository manages artifacts and Docker images, while SSL, AWS RDS, and Vault ensure security and data persistence. New Relic provides comprehensive monitoring for both application and infrastructure.


### [Configuring a secure Ngnix Server Using Let's Encrypt](https://dev.to/ejay11/configuring-a-secure-nginx-server-using-lets-encrypt-with-certbot-hgl)
This project demonstrates the setup of a secure Nginx web server using Let's Encrypt and Certbot. It covers Nginx installation on Ubuntu, AWS Route 53 configuration for domain management, and implementation of HTTPS encryption. The process includes creating Nginx server blocks, automating SSL certificate management, configuring firewalls, and DNS setup. The end result is a fully functional, secure web server with automated certificate renewal, verified through browser testing
